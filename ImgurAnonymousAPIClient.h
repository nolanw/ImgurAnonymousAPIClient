/**
 * An ImgurAnonymousAPIClient anonymously uploads images to Imgur.
 *
 * In order to use the ImgurAnonymousAPIClient, you must register your application with the Imgur API. Please go to https://api.imgur.com and register your application, then be sure to specify your client ID when creating an ImgurAnonymousAPIClient (or put it in your Info.plist; see the documentation for ImgurAnonymousAPIClientInfoPlistClientIDKey).
 *
 * Imgur describes at https://imgur.com/faq#types the types of images that it will accept.
 *
 * Imgur describes at https://imgur.com/faq#size a maximum file size for uploads. Currently it's 10MB for static images and 2MB for animated images. However, images larger than 1MB are shrunk down to 1MB, so if you need a target to aim for, that's a good one.
